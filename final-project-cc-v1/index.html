          Resident Evil is a long-running survival horror series that began in 1996 on the Playstation 1. Since those original chunky graphics and clunky controls, the series has evolved through several phases of different game design styles, all with survival horror as its core principle. The series has never been afraid to take risks, and done so with quality. This has kept the series alive by breathing new life into the formula whenever it began to get stale. Today, there are 8 mainline Resident Evil titles, with the most recent being Resident Evil Village as the eigth installment (Though it should be noted, some consider Resident Evil 0 as a mainline entry, making the total mainline games 9). There are also more than 15 spin-off titles in the series.
