        </h1>
       <p>
        Captain Chris Redfield is an American operator in the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), in which he has served since its foundation in 2003. Redfield has built up and dedicated his career in destroying Bio Organic Weapons and fighting against producers and sellers of bioweapons after his experiences with bioterrorism in 1998. He is the older brother of TerraSave member Claire Redfield. He is also the mentor of American superhuman Rosemary Winters. <br>
        Chris might be the de facto face of the series, if not for Leon S. Kennedy being the fan favorite. Chris has appeared in more Resident Evil games than any other character, and has had just as many re-designs. His Resident Evil 7 look was controversial for changing his hair color and making him near-unrecognizable. Thankfully, Resident Evil 8 returned to form and depicted Chris as the 'roided-out muscle man he has slowly become since the original game. However, Chris isn't just a meathead military man; Resident Evil 5 takes a different approach to the character. The ga<span class="special-color">me ta</span>ckles Chris's mental struggles after losing his squad in a previous animated movie. While this side of Chris hasn't been seen since 2012, it serves to make him a more interesting and likable character through his vulnerabilities.
