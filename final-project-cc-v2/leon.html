        </h1>
       <p>
        Leon Scott Kennedy is an American of Italian descent currently employed as a federal agent by the Division of Security Operations (D.S.O.), a counter-terrorism agency with direct Presidential oversight. Kennedy is a known survivor of the 1998 Raccoon City Destruction Incident, then as a police officer. Following his escape, he was offered a job in a US.STRATCOM team devoted to anti-B.O.W. combat, where he served until 2011 in repeated operations around the world. <br>
        Leon S. Kennedy is the fan-favorite of the Resident Evil community. While he started off as a naive rookie cop, thanks to Resident Evil 4 he became the quippy, sexy, and sarcastic action hero. While hints of that naive cop still peak through (especially in the more recent TV show and comics), Leon is canonically one of the best special operatives in the world of Resident Evil. He also has very obvious feelings for Ada Wong whenever they cross paths.
